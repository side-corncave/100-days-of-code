# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, March 03, 2023

Decided to do the challenge in order to learn to code. To begin with, I am choosing Python because it's the only languguage whose fundamentals I'm familiar with.

Don't have any project ideas at the moment. So, I plan on starting with an [online list](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/) and working through it. If I have any ideas on what I want to make in the meantime, I'll just switch to my own idea.

### Day 1: Saturday, March 04, 2023

Day 1 went well. Made two very simple things - a [substitution cipher code generator](https://github.com/side-corncave/AtbashEncoderDecoder) and a [day counter](https://github.com/side-corncave/day_counter). The datetime module on python was a bit of a challenging one to figure out. Also, couldn't figure out how to write the cipher program in a way where all the output characters are printed out in one line. But it's a start.

### Day 2: Sunday, March 05, 2023

Made a very basic [temperature converter](https://github.com/side-corncave/C2F_and_back_converter). Spent the rest of the time learning about regular expressions. Finding regular expressions a bit difficult to grasp, might need to look for exercises online for practice.

### Day 3: Monday, March 06, 2023

Did some python practice problems from a book. Was extremely difficult and felt like giving almost the entire time. But somehow ended up finishing right before the timer ran out. Very glad that I stuck it out.

### Day 4: Tuesday, March 07, 2023

Continued with solving practice problems, specifically using an infinite series by Srinivasa Ramanujan to calculate the value of pi. I still do find recursive functions a bit challenging, and debugging is still very difficult. Looked a bit into the built-in options inside VS Code to debug code as well.

### Day 5: Wednesday, March 08, 2023

Spent the entirety of the time on regular expressions today. It's not that this is something very difficult, the rules and syntax are a bit confusing for me (and probably other beginners as well). Watched some online videos on the topic and read the official python documentation on regular expressions. I might have to look for and design a few exercises on RE later today, and then do them tomorrow.

### Day 6: Thursday, March 09, 2023

Worked on solving problems. Specifically working with text from files and functions to work with them. After that, watches a few more videos on hadling files on python.

### Day 7: Friday, March 10, 2023

Was a very busy day and almost missed today. But glad that I managed to find some time to code. Worked on a new problem. Specifically a problem which required writing a function to do searching. Challenging work but nothing world changing. At least I'm learning and am in practice.

### Day 8: Sunday, March 12, 2023

Another day of trying to solve puzzles. After I was done, I checked a possible solution. It seems that an issue now is that the way I think is often too complicated. The problem with this is that it is often difficult for me to approach a solution in this way, and it is very easy for bugs to to appear in the code. I'm not entirely certain on how to address this issue in my code. One possible way might be trying to read more code and trying to understand how they work and why things are done the way they are. And of course, practice would probably help.

### Day 9: Monday, March 13, 2023

Spent the day solving practice problems again. While it's true that this is a bit different from the initial plan I made, this has been helpful so far because it's helping me gain better clarity on a lot of basic aspects of python programming. Working through the problems of the textbook really has been hard, challenging and helpful till now.
