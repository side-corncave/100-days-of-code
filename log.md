# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, March 03, 2023

Decided to do the challenge in order to learn to code. To begin with, I am choosing Python because it's the only languguage whose fundamentals I'm familiar with.

Don't have any project ideas at the moment. So, I plan on starting with an [online list](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/) and working through it. If I have any ideas on what I want to make in the meantime, I'll just switch to my own idea.

### Day 1: Saturday, March 04, 2023

Day 1 went well. Made two very simple things - a [substitution cipher code generator](https://github.com/side-corncave/AtbashEncoderDecoder) and a [day counter](https://github.com/side-corncave/day_counter). The datetime module on python was a bit of a challenging one to figure out. Also, couldn't figure out how to write the cipher program in a way where all the output characters are printed out in one line. But it's a start.

### Day 2: Sunday, March 05, 2023

Made a very basic [temperature converter](https://github.com/side-corncave/C2F_and_back_converter). Spent the rest of the time learning about regular expressions. Finding regular expressions a bit difficult to grasp, might need to look for exercises online for practice.

### Day 3: Monday, March 06, 2023

Did some python practice problems from a book. Was extremely difficult and felt like giving almost the entire time. But somehow ended up finishing right before the timer ran out. Very glad that I stuck it out.

### Day 4: Tuesday, March 07, 2023

Continued with solving practice problems, specifically using an infinite series by Srinivasa Ramanujan to calculate the value of pi. I still do find recursive functions a bit challenging, and debugging is still very difficult. Looked a bit into the built-in options inside VS Code to debug code as well.

### Day 5: Wednesday, March 08, 2023

Spent the entirety of the time on regular expressions today. It's not that this is something very difficult, the rules and syntax are a bit confusing for me (and probably other beginners as well). Watched some online videos on the topic and read the official python documentation on regular expressions. I might have to look for and design a few exercises on RE later today, and then do them tomorrow.

### Day 6: Thursday, March 09, 2023

Worked on solving problems. Specifically working with text from files and functions to work with them. After that, watches a few more videos on hadling files on python.

### Day 7: Friday, March 10, 2023

Was a very busy day and almost missed today. But glad that I managed to find some time to code. Worked on a new problem. Specifically a problem which required writing a function to do searching. Challenging work but nothing world changing. At least I'm learning and am in practice.
