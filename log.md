# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday, March 03, 2023

Decided to do the challenge in order to learn to code. To begin with, I am choosing Python because it's the only languguage whose fundamentals I'm familiar with.

Don't have any project ideas at the moment. So, I plan on starting with an [online list](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/) and working through it. If I have any ideas on what I want to make in the meantime, I'll just switch to my own idea.

### Day 1: Saturday, March 04, 2023

Day 1 went well. Made two very simple things - a [substitution cipher code generator](https://github.com/side-corncave/AtbashEncoderDecoder) and a [day counter](https://github.com/side-corncave/day_counter). The datetime module on python was a bit of a challenging one to figure out. Also, couldn't figure out how to write the cipher program in a way where all the output characters are printed out in one line. But it's a start.

### Day 2: Sunday, March 05, 2023

Made a very basic [temperature converter](https://github.com/side-corncave/C2F_and_back_converter). Spent the rest of the time learning about regular expressions. Finding regular expressions a bit difficult to grasp, might need to look for exercises online for practice.
